This project is my personal drone project made out of stm32 development board and other quadcopter components. The project is still work in progress, though I haven't touched on this project for an while. The project has been kept private for an while, because it was not written well or in organized way for others to understand easily. Still, I decided to keep this repository public so that others who were interested in my other GY86 repository may get some idea of how to utilize the sensor in quadcopter field.

This project is mainly inspired by this project: https://github.com/ChrisWonyeobPark/M-HIVE-STM32_drone_programming_course-MH-FC-FW1.0
